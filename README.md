### What I learned

In the result summary component project, I had the opportunity to deepen my understanding of CSS gradients, specifically linear gradients. By experimenting with different gradient directions.


### Continued development

I plan to continue exploring the creative possibilities of CSS gradients and to expand my knowledge and skills in this area. Specifically, I would like to learn more about how to use radial gradients and how to create complex gradients using multiple color stops and blending modes.
### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/gradient/linear-gradient) - This website was an invaluable resource for me during this project. Specifically, the documentation on linear gradients in CSS provided me with the information and guidance I needed to create visually stunning backgrounds and elements.
